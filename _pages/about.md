## About
I am currently a first year MPhil student in Computer Science at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk) (HKUST) supervised by [Amir Goharshady](https://amir.goharshady.com). I also received my Bachelor's degree from HKUST with Computer Engineering as my major.

## Research
I am a proud member of the [ALPACAS Research group](https://amir.goharshady.com/alpacas-research-group), which is led by my supervisor and focuses its research on Algorithms, Logic, Program Analysis, Cryptocurrencies and Smart contracts. We are a strong and diverse group that has the highest number of Hong Kong PhD Fellowship (HKPF) awardees and also its highest success rate (100%). We even have more IOI, IMO, IMC, and ICPC medals than most countries.

My research focus lies within the intersection of Cryptography and Blockchain, in which I design and implement secure blockchain protocol by leveraging various cryptographic and game-theoretic tools. I also work on the cryptographic tools themselves to improve their security. One of my recent focuses is [Zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof).
