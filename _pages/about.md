## About
I am currently a year 2 MPhil student in Computer Science at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk) (HKUST) supervised by [Amir Goharshady](https://amir.goharshady.com). I also received my Bachelor's degree from HKUST with Computer Engineering as my major.

## Research
I am a proud member of the [ALPACAS Research group](https://amir.goharshady.com/group), which is led by my supervisor and focuses its research on Algorithms, Logic, Program Analysis, Cryptocurrencies and Smart contracts.

My research focus lies within the intersection of Cryptography and Blockchain, in which I design and implement secure blockchain protocol by leveraging various cryptographic and game-theoretic tools. I also work on the cryptographic tools themselves to improve their security. Prior to that, I also have numerous projects and internship experiences in the AI field.
